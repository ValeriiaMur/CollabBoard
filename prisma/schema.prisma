// DEPRECATED — Prisma has been replaced by Firebase Firestore.
// Database schema is now defined by Firestore collections:
//   - users (managed by @auth/firebase-adapter)
//   - accounts (managed by @auth/firebase-adapter)
//   - sessions (managed by @auth/firebase-adapter)
//   - boards { name, ownerId, createdAt, updatedAt }
//
// This file is no longer used. Safe to delete.
